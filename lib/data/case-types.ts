 "Personal injury loss of earnings is one of the most significant heads of damage in serious injury claims. Employment loss expert witnesses establish the claimant's pre-accident earnings position, assess residual earning capacity post-injury, and calculate past and future financial loss using the multiplier/multiplicand method with Ogden Tables 8th Edition.",
 "Where the claimant is self-employed, a business owner, or has an unusual earnings history, vocational and forensic accounting expertise is essential to establish a reliable earnings baseline. Smith v Manchester awards may apply where the claimant faces handicap on the open labour market but future loss cannot be precisely quantified.",

 ],
 faqs: [
 {
 question: "How is future loss of earnings calculated in personal injury?",
 answer:
 "The multiplier/multiplicand method applies: the multiplicand is the annual net earnings loss; the multiplier is derived from the Ogden Tables 8th Edition, adjusted for age, sex, employment status, and whether the claimant is disabled under the Equality Act 2010 definition, then further adjusted for the prescribed discount rate of -0.25%. The resulting lump sum represents the present value of all future earnings losses.",
 },
 {
 question: "When is a Smith v Manchester award appropriate?",
 answer:
 "A Smith v Manchester award is appropriate where a claimant has an established career pre-accident and faces a risk on the open labour market post-injury, but where it is not possible to calculate future loss precisely using the multiplier/multiplicand method. The award is a lump sum, typically up to 2 years' net earnings, assessed by reference to the degree of risk and the claimant's labour market position.",

For senior employees and high earners, this significantly increases exposure and makes precise expert evidence of actual financial loss essential rather than approximate.",

 "A Polkey reduction reflects the chance that the claimant would have been dismissed anyway even if a fair procedure had been followed. The tribunal applies a percentage reduction (e.g. 25%, 50%) to the compensatory award. Employment loss experts model the financial impact of different percentage outcomes, helping attorneys advise on likely ranges and settlement strategy.",
