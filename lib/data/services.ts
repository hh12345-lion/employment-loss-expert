 question: "When is a loss of earnings report needed in a PI claim?",
 answer:
 "A loss of earnings report is needed whenever loss of earnings is a significant head of damage, including self-employed claimants, business owners, unusual earnings histories, career changes due to injury, or where Smith v Manchester is in issue.",
 },
 {
 question: "What documents are required for a PI loss of earnings report?",
 answer:
 "Typically 5 years of tax returns and P60s, employment contracts, employer references, medical evidence on functional capacity, and evidence of post-injury employment attempts or residual earning capacity.",

 question: "How are Ogden Tables used in loss of earnings reports?",
 answer:
 "The expert applies Ogden Tables 8th Edition multipliers to the annual net earnings loss (multiplicand), adjusted for age, sex, employment status, disability status, and the -0.25% discount rate under the Civil Liability Act 2018.",

 question: "What is residual earning capacity?",
 answer:
 "Residual earning capacity is what the claimant can realistically earn post-injury or post-dismissal, considering medical limitations, transferable skills, and labour market conditions. It forms the basis of the multiplicand in PI claims.",
 },
 {
 question: "Who provides residual earning capacity evidence?",
 answer:
 "Typically an employment consultant or vocational rehabilitation expert with labour market expertise. In complex cases, they work alongside a forensic accountant who quantifies the financial loss.",

 {
 question: "When is a Smith v Manchester award appropriate?",
 answer:
 "Where a claimant has an established career and faces risk on the open labour market post-injury, but future loss cannot be precisely calculated using the multiplier/multiplicand method. Typically awarded as up to 2 years' net earnings.",
 },
 {
 question: "What is the difference between Smith v Manchester and the multiplier method?",
 answer:
 "The multiplier method provides actuarially precise capitalisation of future loss. Smith v Manchester is a lump sum fallback where precision is impossible due to uncertain prognosis or fluctuating earning capacity.",

 },
 {
 question: "Is pension loss recoverable in ET claims?",
 answer:
 "Yes. Pension loss is a recognised head of compensatory award in unfair dismissal and discrimination claims, calculated as weekly pension loss multiplied by the relevant period.",
