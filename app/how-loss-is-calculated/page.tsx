 Employment loss is calculated differently depending on the forum. Personal injury claims
 use the multiplier/multiplicand method with Ogden Tables. Employment tribunal claims
 assess actual financial loss with immediate and future components. Family court proceedings
 focus on earning capacity and loss of career. This guide explains each framework, the key
 variables, and when employment loss expert witnesses are required.

 <h2>1. Personal Injury Method: Multiplier/Multiplicand</h2>
 <p>
 The multiplicand is the annual net earnings loss (pre-accident earnings minus post-injury
 residual earnings). The multiplier, derived from Ogden Tables 8th Edition, capitalises
 future loss into a present value lump sum. The discount rate of -0.25% under the Civil
 Liability Act 2018 adjusts the multiplier upward.

 <h2>2. Ogden Tables Explained</h2>
 <p>
 The Ogden Tables are actuarial tables published by the Government Actuary&apos;s Department
 for capitalising future losses in personal injury. The 8th Edition (2020) is mandatory for
 all new claims. Tables 1 to 8 provide working life multipliers by age and sex. Tables 9
 to 26 cover various life scenarios. Table H addresses pension loss.
 </p>
 <p>
 Ogden 8 introduced reduction factors for contingencies other than mortality, applied
 differently for &quot;disabled&quot; and &quot;not disabled&quot; claimants using the Equality Act 2010
 definition. The disability reduction factor significantly reduces the multiplier for
 claimants who are disabled post-injury. Experts must justify table selection. See our{" "}
 <Link href="/guides/ogden-tables-loss-of-earnings-guide">Ogden Tables guide</Link>.
 </p>

 <h2>3. Smith v Manchester Awards</h2>
 <p>
 Where a claimant with an established career faces risk on the open labour market
 post-injury but future loss cannot be precisely calculated, a Smith v Manchester award
 applies. Typically up to 2 years&apos; net earnings as a lump sum. The multiplier method is
 preferred where reliable data exists.{" "}
 <Link href="/guides/smith-v-manchester-guide">Read our Smith v Manchester guide</Link>.
 </p>

 <h2>4. Employment Tribunal Method</h2>
 <p>
 ET compensatory awards cover immediate loss (dismissal to hearing or new employment),
 future loss (time to find comparable work), pension loss, and loss of statutory rights
 (£500 conventional). Polkey reductions and contributory fault may reduce the award.
 Mitigation credit applies where the claimant unreasonably failed to seek alternative
 employment.
 </p>
 <p>
 From 1 January 2027, ERA 2025 removes the compensatory award cap.{" "}

 <h2>5. Family Law Method</h2>
 <p>
 Family court employment experts conduct career model analysis, earning capacity assessment,
 and loss of career calculation. Economic disadvantage may be relevant in Scottish
 proceedings. Reports must comply with FPR Part 25.{" "}
 <Link href="/practice-areas/family-law">Family law practice area</Link>.
 </p>

 <h2>The Discount Rate (-0.25%)</h2>
 <p>
 The discount rate reflects the assumed real return on investment of a lump sum award. Set
 at -0.25% by the Lord Chancellor under the Civil Liability Act 2018, it reflects the
 low interest rate environment and the Insurance (Liabilities to Third Parties) Act 1996.
 A negative discount rate increases multipliers and therefore increases future loss awards
 in PI claims. The rate is reviewed periodically.
 </p>

 <h2>Mitigation</h2>
 <p>
 In all proceedings, claimants must take reasonable steps to mitigate their loss by finding
 alternative employment, retraining, or accepting comparable work. Employment experts assess
 whether mitigation was reasonable and what loss would have been avoided by proper
 mitigation. Failure to mitigate may reduce awards in both PI and ET claims.
