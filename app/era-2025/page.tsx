 <h2>The Most Significant Change to ET Compensation in a Decade</h2>
 <p>
 The Employment Rights Act 2025 removes both statutory caps on unfair dismissal
 compensation (the lower of 52 weeks&apos; gross pay or £118,223) from 1 January 2027.
 Tribunals will assess compensation based solely on the employee&apos;s actual financial
 loss.

 <h2>Why Uncapped Awards Mean Expert Evidence Is Now Essential</h2>
 <p>
 Under the current capped regime, many ET cases settle with rough estimates of future loss
 because the cap limits exposure. From January 2027, for senior employees and high earners,
 uncapped awards mean the financial stakes are far higher. Tribunals will scrutinise actual
 loss evidence carefully, requiring the same rigour as High Court personal injury or
 commercial litigation.
 </p>

 <h2>The Polkey Question: More Important Than Ever</h2>
 <p>
 With the cap removed, Polkey deductions may become a crucial tool in an employer&apos;s
 arsenal when a tribunal is considering remedy for ordinary unfair dismissal, particularly
 when dealing with senior exits. Employment loss experts model the financial impact of
 different Polkey percentage outcomes, giving attorneys the data they need to advise
 clients on realistic exposure and settlement strategy.
 </p>

 <h2>What attorneys Need to Do Now</h2>
 <ol>
 <li>
 Review existing ET cases where dismissal date falls after 1 January 2027: uncapped rules
 will apply
 </li>
 <li>
 Instruct employment loss experts early in significant cases to establish baseline loss
 figures
 </li>
 <li>
 Consider Polkey arguments: document performance issues, process steps, and business case
 now
 </li>
 <li>Update standard Schedule of Loss templates for uncapped methodology</li>
 </ol>

 <h2>Employees Recruited Before 1 July 2026: Already Affected</h2>
 <p>
 Any employee recruited on or before 1 July 2026 will immediately gain the right to claim
 unfair dismissal on 1 January 2027, meaning the new law already impacts on recruiting
 decisions being made now.
