 <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
 <p>
 Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website. We also use
 similar technologies such as local storage for your cookie consent preferences.
 </p>

 <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
 <p>We group cookies into four categories:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>
 <strong>Necessary</strong>: Required for the site to function, including storing your
 consent choices. These cannot be switched off.
 </li>
 <li>
 <strong>Analytics</strong>: Help us understand how visitors use our site (e.g. Google
 Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Hotjar). Loaded only if you consent.
 </li>
 <li>
 <strong>Marketing</strong>: Used to measure advertising and reach relevant audiences
 (e.g. Meta Pixel, LinkedIn Insight Tag). Loaded only if you consent.
 </li>
 <li>
 <strong>Preferences</strong>: Remember settings to improve your experience. Loaded only
 if you consent.
 </li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Your Choices (GDPR & ePrivacy)</h2>
 <p>
 On your first visit, we ask for your consent before loading non-essential cookies. You may
 accept all, reject non-essential, or customise categories. You can change your mind at any
 time using <strong>Cookie Settings</strong> in the footer.
 </p>
 <p>
 We store your consent in local storage for up to 365 days, after which we will ask again.
 </p>

 <h2>Google Consent Mode</h2>
 <p>
 Where Google services are enabled, we use Google Consent Mode v2 so that tags respect your
 choices before and after you interact with the banner. Analytics and advertising storage
 remain denied until you grant the relevant category.
 </p>

 <h2>Third-Party Cookies</h2>
 <p>
 Third-party providers may set their own cookies when their scripts load. We only activate
 those scripts after consent. Please refer to each provider&apos;s privacy policy for
 details.
 </p>

 <h2>California Residents (CCPA)</h2>
 <p>
 If you are a California resident, you may have rights to know what personal information is
 collected and to opt out of certain sharing. Rejecting marketing and analytics cookies
 limits related tracking on this site.
 </p>
