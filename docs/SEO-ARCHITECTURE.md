**Version:** 1.0

## Document purpose

This is the single source of truth for SEO on EmploymentLossExpert.com: keyword targeting, content clusters, internal linking, structured data, generative-engine optimization (GEO), off-page targets, competitor monitoring, timing strategy, and deployment. Content, development, and outreach should align to this document.

| Audience | Primary goal |
|----------|----------------|
| PI and clinical negligence solicitors | Loss of earnings, Ogden Tables, Smith v Manchester |
| Employment law solicitors | ET compensation, ERA 2025 uncapped awards, Polkey |
| Family law solicitors | Loss of career, FPR Part 25 employment reports |

**Primary ranking goal:** employment loss expert witness (UK and non-geo variants) and closely related transactional queries.

**Implementation reference:** Routes and data live under `app/`, `lib/data/`, `lib/schema/`, and `lib/seo/publicUrlInventory.ts`. Regenerate sitemap with `npm run seo:generate`.

---

## URL canonicalization

Canonical URLs use **build-spec slugs** (keyword-rich, match H1s and `lib/data/*`). Where the original SEO brief used shorter paths, use the canonical URL below.

| SEO brief (alias) | Canonical URL |
|-------------------|---------------|
| `/case-types/clinical-negligence` | `/case-types/clinical-negligence-employment-loss` |
| `/case-types/personal-injury-loss` | `/case-types/personal-injury-loss-of-earnings` |
| `/guides/ogden-tables-loss-of-earnings` | `/guides/ogden-tables-loss-of-earnings-guide` |
| `/glossary#polkey` | `/glossary#polkey-reduction` |
| `/guides/era-2025-loss-guide` | `/guides/era-2025-et-loss-guide` |

Do not publish duplicate content at alias paths. If aliases are ever needed, use 301 redirects to canonical URLs.

## 3. Internal linking rules

### Rule 1: `/how-loss-is-calculated` must link to

- All 3 `/practice-areas/[slug]` pages
- Relevant `/case-types/*` (at least PI, ET, and family exemplars)
- All methodology glossary terms (use fragment URLs from Appendix C)
- `/guides/ogden-tables-loss-of-earnings-guide`, `/guides/smith-v-manchester-guide`, `/guides/era-2025-et-loss-guide`
- `/contact`

### Rule 2: `/era-2025` must link to

- `/practice-areas/employment-tribunal`
- `/how-loss-is-calculated` (ET section anchor when fragment exists)
- `/guides/era-2025-et-loss-guide`
- `/case-types/unfair-dismissal-et`
- `/glossary#polkey-reduction`
- `/contact`

### Rule 3: Every `/practice-areas/[slug]` must link to

- At least 3 relevant `/case-types/[slug]` pages
- Relevant `/services#` sections
- Relevant `/guides/[slug]`
- `/how-loss-is-calculated`
- `/qualifications`
- `/contact`

### Rule 4: Every `/case-types/[slug]` must link to

- Parent `/practice-areas/[slug]`
- Relevant `/services#` section
- Relevant `/guides/[slug]` where applicable
- `/how-loss-is-calculated`
- `/glossary` (2+ key term fragments)
- `/how-to-instruct`
- `/contact`

### Rule 5: Every `/guides/[slug]` must link to

- `/guides` hub
- Relevant `/practice-areas/*`
- Relevant `/case-types/*`
- `/how-loss-is-calculated`
- `/era-2025` (where ERA/ET relevant)
- `/how-to-instruct`
- `/contact`

### Rule 6: Glossary terms must link to

### Anchor text guidelines

- Use descriptive, UK legal phrasing: e.g. "ET Schedule of Loss guide", "Ogden Tables 8th Edition", "ERA 2025 uncapped awards".
- Avoid "click here", "read more" without context, and bare URLs in visible copy.
- Match user search language where natural (expert witness, loss of earnings, employment tribunal).

### Minimum links per template (development)

| Template | Minimum outbound link types |
|----------|----------------------------|
| Case type | 7 (rules 4) |
| Practice area | 6 (rules 3) |
| Guide | 6 (rules 5) |
| Glossary term | 1 primary `link` in data; add fragment `id` on term for inbound deep links |

**Component pattern:** Implement reusable `RelatedLinks` / `InThisSection` blocks fed from hub metadata in `lib/data/` to enforce rules at build time. Run `scripts/verify-seo.ts` (or future link audit) before release.

**Glossary deep links:** Add `id` attributes on each glossary `<dt>` matching Appendix C fragment IDs (currently terms render without fragment IDs; add for deep linking and Rule 6).

---

## 4. Schema architecture

Structured data is implemented in `lib/schema/` and injected via `components/JsonLd.tsx`.

### Root entity

| Property | Value |
|----------|--------|
| `@id` | `https://www.employmentlossexpert.com/#organization` |
| Type | `Organization` |
| `areaServed` | United Kingdom (`GB`) |
| `sameAs` | LinkedIn (see `LINKEDIN_URL` in `lib/site.ts`) |

### Schema graph by page

| Page(s) | Schema type(s) | Implementation notes |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| `/` | `@graph`: Organization, WebSite, ProfessionalService, SearchAction | `organizationSchema()` in `lib/schema/organization.ts`; `hasOfferCatalog` references 8 services |
| `/services` | 8× `Service` | `servicesPageSchema()`; fragment `@id`s below |
| `/how-loss-is-calculated` | `Article` | `articleSchema()`; `about` → `#loss-of-earnings-pi` |
| `/era-2025` | `Article` | `about` → `#et-schedule-of-loss` |
| `/guides/[slug]` ×6 | `Article` | Per-guide `aboutServiceId` in `lib/data/guides.ts` |
| `/faq` | `FAQPage` | 12 Q&As from `lib/data/faq.ts` |
| `/glossary` | `FAQPage` | 32 terms as question/answer pairs |
| `/practice-areas/*` ×3 | `FAQPage` | 2 FAQs per practice area page |
| `/case-types/*` ×10 | `FAQPage` | 2 FAQs per case type |
| All indexed pages except `/thank-you` | `BreadcrumbList` | `breadcrumbSchema()` |

### Service fragment IDs (`/services#…`)

### Exclusions

| Path | Robots | Schema |
|------|--------|--------|
| `/thank-you` | noindex, nofollow | None |
| `/privacy`, `/terms` | noindex, follow | None |
| `/contact` | index (excluded from sitemap only) | BreadcrumbList |

### Validation checklist

## 5. GEO optimization targets

Content structured for AI citation and featured snippets: **definition-first**, tables with clear headers, UK-specific figures, solicitor audience.

| # | Asset | Page | Section / anchor | Required structure |
|---|--------|------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Three frameworks comparison | `/how-loss-is-calculated` | The Three Frameworks | Table: Framework \| Court/Tribunal \| Method \| Key Variables |
| 2 | Multiplier / multiplicand steps | `/how-loss-is-calculated` | PI method | Table: Step \| Description \| Tool |
| 3 | ET Schedule of Loss heads | `/how-loss-is-calculated` | ET method | Table: Head \| Calculation |
| 4 | ERA 2025 changes | `/era-2025` | Key Changes at a Glance | Table: Change \| When \| Impact on Expert Evidence |
| 5 | Ogden Tables explanation | `/guides/ogden-tables-loss-of-earnings-guide` | Full guide | 8th Edition, disability definition, reduction factors |
| 6 | Smith v Manchester explained | `/guides/smith-v-manchester-guide` | Full guide | When applicable vs multiplier method |
| 7 | Polkey reduction | `/practice-areas/employment-tribunal` | Polkey section | Definition + uncapped context |
| 8 | Vento bands table | `/case-types/discrimination-employment-loss` | Injury to feelings | Table: Band \| Range (2025 figures) |
| 9 | UK employment statistics | `/` | By the Numbers | Table: Fact \| Figure \| Source |
| 10 | Glossary | `/glossary` | All 32 terms | Term → one-sentence definition → detail → internal link |

**Glossary GEO rule:** First sentence of each definition must stand alone as an answer. Expand below with proceeding context and one canonical internal link (see `lib/data/glossary.ts`).

**Copy rule:** No em dashes (U+2014) anywhere on the site. Use commas, colons, or hyphens.

## 6. Off-page SEO targets

### Expert witness directories (submit and monitor monthly)

| Directory | URL / notes |
|-----------|-------------|
| UK Register of Expert Witnesses | jspubs.com |
| Academy of Experts | academyofexperts.org |
| Expert Witness Institute (EWI) | experts.org.uk |
| NAPIER | Professional employment experts in rehabilitation |
| APIL expert directory | APIL membership |
| Resolution | Family solicitors network |
| Law Society expert finder | Law Society |

**Cadence:** Monthly check listing live, category correct (loss of earnings / employment), ERA 2025 and Ogden 8 mentioned in profile.

**UTM pattern for directory and PR links:**

```text
?utm_source={source}&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=expert-directory
```

Example: `https://www.employmentlossexpert.com/era-2025?utm_source=jspubs&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=expert-directory`

### Legal publications (thought leadership targets)

- Personal Injury Law Journal  
- Employment Law Journal  
- Family Law journal  
- Practical Law (Thomson Reuters)  
- Lexis PSL Employment  
- IDS Employment Law Brief  

### Digital PR angles

1. **ERA 2025:** Why Every Significant ET Case Will Now Need an Employment Loss Expert  
2. **Polkey in an Uncapped World:** The New Employer Defence  
3. **Smith v Manchester vs Multiplier/Multiplicand:** Which Award Should Solicitors Choose?  
4. **Ogden Tables 8th Edition:** What Changed and What Solicitors Need to Know  
5. **Vento Bands 2025 Update:** Current Injury to Feelings Award Ranges  

**LinkedIn:** Company page **EmploymentLossExpert** — link from Organization `sameAs` and footer.

**Outreach owner:** Assign named owner per quarter; track placements in a simple spreadsheet (title, URL, date, follow-up links built).

---

## 7. Competitor monitoring

### Monthly review (first week of month)

| Competitor | URL | Watch for |
|------------|-----|-----------|
| Trevor Gilbert & Associates | employmentexperts.co.uk | ERA 2025 pages, case types, fees |
| Employment Experts Ltd | expertwitness.co.uk (profile 5763c7e0) | ET/PI positioning |
| jspubs loss of earnings | jspubs.com/expert-witness/si/l/loss-of-earnings/ | New listings, keywords |
| jspubs employment prospects | jspubs.com/expert-witness/si/e/employment-prospects/ | Category overlap |
| Paul Jackson Employment | pauljacksonemployment.co.uk | Content depth, Ogden updates |

### Scorecard template

| Signal | Us | Competitor A | Competitor B | Notes |
|--------|-----|--------------|--------------|-------|
| Dedicated ERA 2025 page | Y/N | | | |
| Ogden 8 / disability content | | | | |
| Case type landing pages | | | | |
| Fee guidance published | | | | |
| Schema FAQPage | | | | |
| ET Schedule of Loss guide | | | | |

**Action:** If a competitor publishes ERA 2025 or Ogden 8 content, update our pillar within 2 weeks (statistics, internal links, PR outreach).

---

## 8. Strategic timing

### Advantage 1: Employment Rights Act 2025

- **1 January 2027:** Statutory cap on ordinary unfair dismissal compensatory awards removed; qualifying period reduces to **6 months**.
- **April 2026:** Protective award increases to 180 days (ERA 2025).
- **6 April 2026:** Sexual harassment as qualifying whistleblowing disclosure; SSP changes.

Solicitors are preparing **now**. `/era-2025` and ERA-themed content across ET pages is the **highest-priority SEO opportunity**. No major competitor has dedicated employment **loss expert** ERA 2025 content at time of writing.

**Content calendar:** Publish and refresh ERA content Q2–Q4 2025; spike updates Q4 2026 ahead of cap removal; refresh statistics after commencement.

### Advantage 2: Ogden Tables 8th Edition

Still actively searched by PI solicitors (disability definition, reduction factors). `/guides/ogden-tables-loss-of-earnings-guide` and PI cluster pages capture this demand. Refresh when Ogden Working Group publishes updates.

### Ongoing refreshes

- Vento band figures when Presidential guidance updates  
- ET cap figure until January 2027 (currently £118,223 / 52 weeks)  
- Homepage "By the Numbers" table sources

## Appendix E: Content guardrails

1. **No em dashes** (Unicode U+2014). Use commas, colons, parentheses, or hyphens.  
2. **UK English** and solicitor-facing tone (precise, professional, not consumer).  
3. **Legal dates must be accurate:**  
   - Unfair dismissal cap removal: **1 January 2027**  
   - Qualifying period 6 months: **1 January 2027**  
   - Protective award 180 days: **April 2026**  
   - Whistleblowing sexual harassment / SSP: **6 April 2026** where cited  
4. **Sources** for statistics tables (ERA 2025, Equality Act 2010, Civil Liability Act 2018, Ogden 8th Edition, Vento 2025).  
5. **Disclaimer** on all pages: referral service, not a law firm, not legal advice.  
6. **ERA 2025 framing:** Expert evidence becomes essential for significant ET cases under uncapped regime; do not overstate legal advice.  
7. **Injury to feelings:** Clarify Vento is tribunal-assessed; experts handle financial heads only.
